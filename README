CDMI Java client library.

1. git clone git@github.com:livenson/libcdmi-java.git
2. mvn install

This will produce a jar file called: libcdmi-1.0.jar in target folder.

There is a sample client you can use: CDMIClient. In order to use this client you need to
create two sample files and a container in the server and define the values in the client
and then you can simply run the client against a CDMI server (endpoint).
