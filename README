version 1.0 developed at PDC Center for High Performance Computing as a part of
Venus-C project. To use this library, you should have following software installed:

1. Java SE 6.0 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 
2. Maven 2.x (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)  

Then you need to issue these commands: 
 
	$ git clone git@github.com:livenson/libcdmi-java.git
	$ cd  libcdmi-java

If you just want to build a jar, run the following command:
	$ mvn install -DskipTests

If you intend to run the junit test cases, edit CDMIConnectionTest.java according to
your settings: libcdmi-java/src/test/java/eu/venusc/cdmi/CDMIConnectionWrapper.java

	cdmiServer: url to your server cdmiServer = new URL("http://hostname:port"); 	
  credentials = new UsernamePasswordCredentials("aaa", "aaa");

Before isussing the following command make sure your vcdm server is up and running.
	$ mvn install
